                <p class="text-indent">I was asked by the owner of Northern Utah Case Management (NUCASE), a local DSPD service helping those with disabilities, to create a website that was user friendly, fun, and easy to understand. Since NUCASE's target audience are those with special needs and usability limitations, it was essential that this project is designed with the user in mind. The website needed to function properly, while also keeping a playful tone to draw the user's attention. In addition to creating a new website layout, I also worked closely with the client to create a new logo for the company. The processes is demonstrated as follows.</p>

It also includes an image of the client with her brother, which is what inspired this business to begin with.</figcaption>

            <p class="text-indent">
                Before I could start this project, I needed to gather as much information about the company as possible. Not only did I need to provide the proper content, but I also needed to display it in a way that was easy for clients (the users) to navigate through. Although NUCASE had an existing website (link unavailable at this time) that provided a lot of content, a lot of the time was spent working with the owner of NUCASE directly to discuss where each paragraph, video, and image needed to be placed. 
            </p>    
            <p class="text-indent">
                In addition, I needed to conduct user research to determine what the goal of the users were, how to best navigate the site, and what design will suit the website best. Due to confidentiality, I was not permitted to test this website with NUCASE’s clients; therefore, I determined that the second best group of people to test with would include the owner of NUCASE, one of NUCASE’s employees who will be using the site frequently, elderly families who are not as tech-savvy, and a family who has experience raising a son with disabilities. This proved to be quite effective and I was able to acquire proper results.

                Since the design for this website had a lot of requirements, deciding on a style was tricky for a variety of reasons. First, the website needed to be both simple as well as fun and attractive to the special need clients, whose brain functionality is more like that of a child. Second, the owner of NUCASE really liked the idea of a background image, which made the design a little tricky when considering typography and color palettes. This is why I felt it necessary to create cards and borders to display the information. Lastly, at this point the logo had not been officially decided yet, so the website didn't have a set color pallette yet. We spent many iterations trying different colors, which took more time than anticipated. In the end, the client was very happy with the final product and felt that it reflected her business the way she wanted to.

              I was really pleased that I was able to help create the brand and logo for Northern Utah Case Management. Working with the client was a delight and it felt wonderful to watch as her sketches, ideas, and vision turned into reality. Her logo perfectly matches her company motto, "Standing out amongst the best!. It symbolizes how one can stand up, stand out and overcome when the fundamental stepping blocks are in place.

              Despite how tricky the design of this website was at first, I am pleased at how excited the client was by the end of the final prototype. This project provided great experience by working with real-world, local businesses and helping the vision of a client become a reality. I especially enjoyed creating the logo which is now being used on all Northern Utah Case Management correspondences, and now being used to print stickers, in-office signs/decor, and more. I hope to work with NUCASE again sometime in the future.
