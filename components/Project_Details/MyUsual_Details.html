        One of the most important aspects of user experience and UX/UI design is finding a need and
        creating a solution that makes a part of the user's life easier. For this project, I was requested to create an
        application that allowed the user to keep track of which restaurants they've eaten at, which meals they've
        tried, and what their thoughts on the meal was. After some deep user research, I discovered that users want a
        way to track specific meals with their own personal opinions, such as if they would try the meal again in the
        future, if allergies were included, or extra notes such as the price or spice level. Unlike review sights such
        as Yelp or Google where anyone can write a review about a restaurant as a whole, my application is personal to
        the user and is used to store notes for meals specifically.

        <h4>Research Methods</h4>
        <div class="mini-underline bg-success my-3"></div>
        <p class="text-indent">The idea for this project was originally stimulated by mother of three picky-eaters, who
          wanted a way to track which meals her kids enjoyed/disliked, which restaurants were in her price range, and if
          there was a reason why she shouldn't eat there again (i.e customer service, wait times, or poor quality food).
          I decided to focus my user testing to those individuals who find themselves eating out more often and exposing
          themselves to digital menus, such as college students, parents of larger families, and those familiar with
          online ordering (such as GrubHub or DoorDash). I conducted a variety of surveys to not only select users under
          this criteria, but to also gain the opinions on what users look for the most when considering which restaurant
          to eat at. Once the selected users were contacted, I moved on to the testing stages by conducting task
          analysis and journey maps.</p>
        <p class="text-indent">After the testing stages were complete and various prototypes were created, changes were
          applied and the final prototype was established. The photo below (see Figure 1) demonstrates the prototype
          that was created in Adobe XD, which is made of multiple pages that connect with one another to create an
          interactive prototype of a functional mobile app. My favorite part was working aside users and pleasing them
          by applying the changes that they requested, and the satisfaction we both feel when the product works like we
          envisioned.</p>

        <h4>Future Work</h4>
        <div class="mini-underline bg-success my-3"></div>
        <p class="text-indent"></p>As of now, this application is only in prototype mode and has barely begun the
        hardcoding stages. I look forward to the future when this app is in full swing and will be used by a wide
        variety of users. Another enjoyable aspect of UX/UI design is that it's constantly evolving, so even this
        application is susceptible to complete change over time. For example, I would like to improve the prototype by
        adding more options to the "sort by" button, giving more options to the meal page such as who added the meal,
        and a way to manage edits when the user adds a duplicate meal. Once the code is finished, I hope that this app
        that will improve the experience of consumers by making their lives easier, even if it's only a little.</p>
